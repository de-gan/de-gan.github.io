								<h3>Who am I?</h3>
								<p>My name is Dennis Gannon and I am a student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I was born and raised in north Jersey as the youngest of three brothers who all loved sports, meaning I was born to be competitive. Outside of college, I am working as a DJ assistant for Elegant Music Group, a professional music and entertainment provider for weddings and corporate events.</p>
								
								<p>I am a man of many interests that I always have an urge to pursue. Although I am not an impulsive person, I love to always challenge myself by teaching myself a new skill and creating new habits. Naturally, I have become well-versed in the process of learning and it brings me an immense sense of fulfillment. As a result, I also love to express my creativity in many different ways.</p>
								
								<p>My goal is to pursue a career that challenges my problem-solving abilities while still being able to support my family and creative endeavors.</p>
								<hr />

								<h4>About my work</h4>
								<p>These presented projects are a cumulnation of lessons learned, stepping stones to larger ideas, and self-proclaimed achievements in my educational and professional journey. I strive to create all my work without straying far from my personal goals and ambition. Therefore, I give myself the liberty to pivot ideas whenever I feel I have exhausted most of the benefits from a project, so I can learn more in the free time I have.</p>

								<p>Although I may have favorites, all projects have educational value and enhance my knowledge. In my creative projects, particularly in my hobbies, I am inspired by the world around me and my life experiences, such as my time abroad in Madrid. I believe my projects can speak for themselves for the most part and I hope you enjoy what I have to offer.</p>
